 # Instabot Trader
 # HI BROWNIE
 This Repo of Instabot Trader does not work on Deribit Test net only live net.
 I havent tried it on the other exchanges so caution
 we are trying to make a new Market Maker mode and it is in development and as such has many bugs and errors when running so please use at own risk. 

  this is my attempt to learn this space so the content in this repo is "use at your own risk" as i/we know i/we will make mistakes here.
